This code is a GUI version of Rock Paper Scissors game with some extra game perimeters to make the game have extra game variables.  

On Linux, the code is the easiest run in the terminal using eithet the "python3 rock-paper-scissors-fire-water.py" or using "./rock-paper-scissors-fire-water.py".
Make sure to use "chmod +x rock-paper-scissors-fire-water.py" before running the script using "./rock-paper-scissors-fire-water.py". 
On Windows/MacOS, the script is the easiest to be run via a IDE. 

This game is meant to serve for me as a introduction and a starting point for me to GUI programming.
